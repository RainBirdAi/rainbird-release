# Rainbird Release

[ ![Codeship Status for RainBirdAi/rainbird-release](https://codeship.com/projects/dd2f7800-53ae-0132-06f4-42f33c882bfd/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/48991)

A tool used to handle releasing from `master` to the `production` branch in git.
The tool assumes a node.js style `package.json` and a file called
`release-notes.md` in the root of the repository.

Once run `rbrelease` will prompt for the version of the release, then open an
editor to allow editing of the release notes. These changes are checked into
`master`, merged into `production` and the `production` branch tagged with the
version number. All changes are then pushed to `origin`.

# Installation

```bash
npm install -g rainbird-release
```

## Usage

```bash

      --tmpdir=PATH  [Optional] The temporary directory to clone the repository to
